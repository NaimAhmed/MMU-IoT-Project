# MMU-IoT-Project
This is my final year Computer Science project creating an Internet of Things (IoT) platform to allow devices such as sensors to connect to and send data.

## A security focused software platform for the Internet of Things applications

The aim of this project is to design and implement a simple security focused software platform that allows developers to add/link real world items to online world. This platform provides authentication and access control infrastructure for objects that helps users to connect to and build their Internet of Things. The project should start by a literature review that discusses the theoretical and technical challenges that faces the development of the Internet of Things. It should also simulate/emulate or use real objects (e.g. mobile device) to test and evaluate the implemented platform.
